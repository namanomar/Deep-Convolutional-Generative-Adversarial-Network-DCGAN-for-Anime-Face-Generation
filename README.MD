# üé® Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for Anime Face Generation üñºÔ∏è

This repository contains the implementation of a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** designed to generate high-quality, realistic anime faces. The project includes models for both the **Generator** and **Discriminator**, along with the training process and monitoring tools for tracking progress.

## üåü Project Overview

- **DCGAN** is an advanced architecture for **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** that uses **deep convolutional layers** to generate high-quality, realistic images.
- The **Generator** creates synthetic images from random noise, while the **Discriminator** distinguishes between real and fake images.
- The two networks are trained in an adversarial setup where the Generator improves to create realistic images, and the Discriminator learns to classify images correctly.
